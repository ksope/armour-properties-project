            <p>
                At NUKP, we believe in creating a brighter, better, healthier
                future for all citizens of the United Kingdom. We are a new
                political party founded on the principles of national progress
                and respect and justice for all citizens, through building a
                stronger, fairer, more just and prosperous nation, where
                everyone can feel the benefits and improvement to their own
                quality of life.

                        We believe in the power of a well informed democracy
                        through the transparency of issues. this will help
                        overcome challenges and achieve beneficial goals for
                        societies and communities. The more people we can engage
                        in national issues at the point of discussion, the more
                        the good, common voice of the people will be heard. We

                    <p>
                        We embrace innovation and forward-thinking policies to
                        address all the issues of our time, from climate change
                        and healthcare to education and economic inequality. We
                        live with some extremely antiquated practices, with
                        present politicians 'say' they are invested in science
                        and technology, but really only benefit themselves and
                        their own wallets. We believe in harnessing the
                        potential of technology and scientific advancements for
                        the betterment of society.

                        We are dedicated to serving the interests of the people
                        first, before the pantomime, pouffe and individual
                        financial profitability that plague the honour of
                        current day politicians.

                        I know it is hard, almost impossible, to believe, but we
                        are an honest party. Yes you scoff, but have you given

                    <p>
                        All our representatives for parliamentary level are
                        chosen on very few basic and interrelated qualities:
                        their honesty, their human qualities and the inherent
                        belief that all humans have a right to a dignified life
                        within a prosperous nation such as ours. Unlike leading
                        politicians of any present recognisable party, their
                        souls are NOT for sale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our representatives are proud to be a part of this
                        nation. We have come to the table not necessarily
                        because we want to. But because we have to. I have had
                        to trong arm many of the representatives towards
                        politics. They have asked why? Simply because they have
                        a character that the public domain need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The absolute negative reputation of ALL politicians
                        today has been the main reason many of our
                        representatives have wanted to stay away from the word
                        'politicians.' I have simply told them, if you stay
                        away, how do you expect the things you want changing to
                        change?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all have a duty to stand up in our nation to take on
                        the awful people who choose themselves to represent us.
                        This party was primarily born as not a single one of us
                        feel there is anyone in today's politics that represents
                        Britain today. We choose to change that. And stand up
                        for the core goodness that we believe still exists in
                        the grand nation of ours.

                        work to strengthen mutual social respect between
                        communities through education, integration and exposure

                        We will pursue policies that promote renewable energy,
                        sustainable development, managing waste and revisit

                            members, non members, friends of the party, enemies
                            of the party; we want everyone to attend. The more
                            voices the more representative we are of the people.
                            And we want that.

                            There is a caveat...yes I know you're thinking 'here
                            we go...' But wait, and see if you agree! The caveat
                            is we do demand courtesy from all attendees of any
                            meetings. Anyone who thinks ill mannered behaviour
                            is acceptable, will be removed from the meeting. We
                            do not hope to remove ill mannered people forever;
                            we know emotions can reach a boiling point when
                            talking about highly emotive issues, but we also
                            know that maybe a chat and some understanding with
                            removed people will put us back on the same page
                            where we can discuss issues politely no matter which
                            angle we come at them from. We hope to engage
                            positively with everyone.
